      (EXPERIMENTAL) A YAML or JSON STRING containing RAW embeds. This will let you do anything but it will get passed directly
      through to the Discord API without any checks, so you have to know what you're doing with it.
      Note that because of limitations on the Actions API, this must be a STRING containing the YAML or JSON.
      Use "|" to preserve whitespace if passing YAML. See https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object

      Discord API with no checks, so you have to know what you're doing. Not all components are available in
      webhook messages (since there is no bot/app on the other end). See https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/using-message-components

      another action should contain newlines, but won't be preserved by the
      Workflow system if it does.
